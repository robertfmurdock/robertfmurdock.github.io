Ok, hopefully the monday Queue Review isn't an ongoing thing. But hey! The highlights:

- Published the "Bossless" quick essay. Its caused some interesting conversations, which was the whole point!
- Built a fairly complex animation system into Coupling for rolling out the pair assignments. Its probably too self indulgent, so people can also turn it off via the tribe config. But its fun! I think so anyway. And it was a good learning exercise for me.
- Another 1000 words into the long form piece. More to come!
- And some more vacation and travel planning, which isn't that exciting.

Go Monday Go!
