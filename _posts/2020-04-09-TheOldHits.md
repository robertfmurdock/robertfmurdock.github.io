I've been posting a lot of new stuff lately but I want to also draw your attention to a few old pieces I've done!

Firstly, here's a paper entitled "Metrics For Continuous Integration". I wrote this paper because I was finding people paying lip service to the idea of 'continuous integration' but not clearly understanding what the principle means, or how to get better at it. Its targeted strictly at egg-head types who really want to "get" the concept, and get a sense of how well their teams are performing, and as such it is extremely dry and non-emotional. It does *not* attempt to make the case for why "continuous integration" is valuable. But it *does* have a whole section of ideas for improving your metrics, which could be useful if you're trying to make your team better.

That paper is on github here: https://github.com/robertfmurdock/TeamCoaching/blob/master/ContinuousIntegrationMetrics.md

Secondly, I've got a paper called "Discipline Fusion Assessment". This paper is intended to help teams that are integrating multiple disciplines (meaning distinct work specializations, such as programmers or graphic-designers) get better at... well, integrating. It covers a lot of common problems that emerge, and has lots of suggestions about how to improve your integration... continuously.

Can you tell I care a lot about teamwork? Heh.

Both of these papers are able to be revised at will, so if you have feedback or thoughts, or even want to make a change, reach out! Given the subjects, I expect the shelf life will be quite long.
