Hey, I just ran some quick numbers on how my Coupling application was being used in 2019. Overall, it looks to be very similar to 2018 (which was a strong year). Here we go!

In 2019, there were:
  - 40 tribes that used Coupling to make pair assignments (at least once). Comparatively, there were 30 in 2018.
  - 1019 spins! Whew. That's impressive. Its interesting how radically different spin rates will be team-to-team. There were 799 in 2018.
  - 287 players on those teams. This is down! There were 312 in 2018. There are probably a few interesting outliers that caused this behavior, but the numbers may be a bit inaccurate as well, due to some backend data modeling transitions the App underwent in 2019.
  
I'm... actually super duper happy about these numbers. For an application that has only ever had word-of-mouth promotion, is extremely lean in its feature set, and is "gloriously garish, and reminds me of the world wide web in the '90s" (paraphrasing), that's a lot of value given to teams.

Its enough to make me believe that, with a little goosing, it could be useful to more people. If you have ideas about how to make that happen, please let me know. I'm bad at that part.

Anyway, I'll post another update Friday about what I've been doing this week. These are exciting times!
