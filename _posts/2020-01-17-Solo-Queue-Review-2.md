Alright, I'm back! Somehow. Yep, these will be updated every week. Some weeks will be less inspiring that others.

This may be one of those weeks, but we'll see.

**shuffles papers**

Here's the haps, dog.

  - The box of writing ideas has been organized, and a few major themes are emerging. It kiiinda feels like all roads lead to discussion continuous integration right now. More ideas are in that box now too... its overflowing, really.
  - A few life things... ordering a new couch and getting a new, real-id compliant driver's license took up a pretty large chunk of time this week. Its amazing the big things that can get done when I have my days at my own command!
  - Last week I did very little coding, and probably as a whiplash effect, this week I did rather a lot. Specifically, I started building out more of the 'pin' feature of Coupling, and using that as an excuse to do more refactoring and general organizing to make it a more viable "code example" repository. I find this kind of focused coding highly relaxing, so I suspect I'm going to have to be more diligent about now using all my time up on that in the future. 

Things that didn't move forward much but are still high priority:

  - More writing, oy, there's so much to do there.
  - More code-project-storming. This is probably turning over some old ideas, dusting them off, and seeing if I can find a hyper-lean project worth executing in there.
  
Alright, quiet week. Its cold here in January. Next time I post I will be older... beware.
