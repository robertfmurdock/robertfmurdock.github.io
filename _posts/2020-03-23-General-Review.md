Mea culpa!

Obviously I haven't updated the solo queue review for some time now. Lots to talk about!

Firstly, I visited Las Vegas, and then Los Angeles, to see friends and family respectively. Great trip! I was able to do a bit of writing while in LA as well, which is why I was able to keep up my fortnightly schedule of publishing.

And that trip happened just as the American response to COVID-19 was just getting started! I snuck back to Michigan and, as its been over two weeks since my flight, it looks like I made it back unscathed.

If you haven't seen them yet, I'm quite happy with my last few columns: [Debossing](https://medium.com/@robert.f.murdock/de-bossing-59b9acdc2168) and [Radical Availability](https://medium.com/@robert.f.murdock/radical-availability-8eeb9ebd465e).

If you think they're worth your time, please share them with people! I know nothing of promotion, but I have a hunch they'll be useful for at least a fistful of people.

I've already got the core of my next column written (tentative title: Listening Like Superman). Unfortunately all the column writing was coming easy, and that means my big paper has stalled for the last few weeks. I'm going to work on getting that particular wheel-of-cheese rolling again this week.

Sadly, my further travel plans have been indefinitely postponed due to corona-mania. Which is pretty disappointing, as I'm in the a pretty unique position these days to take advantage of that.

Which reminds me - I still need to make concrete plans about what I'll be doing regarding work in the future. April will be a month of active option investigation. It'll be interesting to see how COVID-19 affects all of that.

In the meantime, I've also been working on a seamless database transition for Coupling (a web application I provide to teams that pair at no cost). Its a mongo-to-aws-dynamo transition, for those who are curious. As these things always do, it taken much more time than expected, but it looks like I just need to do a final data transfer and switch over. Is sort of thing that interesting to people? Who knows. But I know tons about it now!

Be safe out there, and remember: life is fleeting, so live truthfully. Especially with loved ones. There is *never* enough time.
