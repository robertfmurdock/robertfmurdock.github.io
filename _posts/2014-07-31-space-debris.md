A little cross promotion to celebrate the release of Guardians of the Galaxy: my longtime compadre Jeff Jia and I run an utterly unprofessional pop-culture podcast. If you've been reading this blog and thinking "this would be a lot better if it was being read aloud, had a lot of extra swears, and was actually about Godzilla" then it is ideal for you. Its called Journey Into Mystery Science. The iTunes page is [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/journey-into-mystery-science/id795894884?mt=2) and the related tumblr is [here](http://jmspod.tumblr.com/). And that's all you'll be hearing about those subjects on this blog - here we're sticking to nice, clean, polite, idealogical rantings related to work.
