Third review time. Whew! Getting things done! A little more to show this week.

Firstly, I've put about 4500 words into deconstructing and reconstructing the concept of Continuous Integration. Its an industry buzzword, its completely lost meaning for a lot of people, and apparently I have many, many things to say on the subject. I've got an end in sight *I think* for that paper, but I'm trying not to rush, and so really unpack the elements that bear more discussion. Early feedback has been good! Which is a little surprising, because its *really* all over the map. And I haven't even used *the power cosmic* in it yet (oh, I will).

Secondly, I wrote an quick editorial about Star Wars. Yep. Shamelessly using one of the largest subjects in world culture to drive traffic and stir up trouble. Is it interesting? I hope so. You tell me! And since I'm throwing around word counts, that's about 2000 words, in an extremely casual style.

Thirdly, there's a Coupling new feature! Its not yet been revealed in the UI, but those of you who are clever can actually find the feature. I've added support for the concept of Pins! A pin can be assigned to a pair whenever you spin, and you can make them mean whatever you want!... most likely you'll use them for team chore assignments though. They're fun, I'll probably add some things to reveal them next week.

 Fourthly, the conspiracy has been expanded. Wait, what conspiracy? You didn't hear anything.
 
 Fifthly, I revised and added to my list of viable product ideas. Some of them are pretty spicy.
  There are twelve of them now (including Coupling).  I'm not sure how best to make use of them yet... maybe I'll get some taste tests on which ones connect with people the most. They're usually of a category that may make it difficult to sell, annoyingly enough. Something to noodle.
  
So there! See, I did things. I did lots of things. Don't you dare claim things were not done.
