Hey, a queue review! Today I'll just throw some statistics out, because I calculated them today, and... why not.

Since I started this transitional career phase in mid-January, I've produced:

Essays and papers consisting of about 26,701 words. Naturally this doesn't show the effort of revision, and there's been a *lot* of revision, but its noteworthy.

Code mutations, including 907 distinct commits, 71,508 lines of code added, and 60,550 lines of code removed. This is a lot of mutation! I've been exploring some different organizational approaches, and added some nice features to *testmints*. This does not include commits related to *writing*, which would pad things too much.

So those are the numbers. They're not exactly *dripping* with meaning (like most metrics, they can be understood multiple ways), but they give a flavor of scale. Sadly I don't have anything from different times in my career to compare them too.
