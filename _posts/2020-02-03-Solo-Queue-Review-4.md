Yep, review is late this week. Here's why: I put a lot of time into building out the Coupling Adventure games systems and didn't come up for air until around 6pm on Friday.

So this slipped. Oops.

Anywho, here's what else I worked on last week:

- Added two new sections / essays to my long form piece, totaling about 1300 words.
- General visual streamlining to Coupling
- Finished the first release of pin functionality in Coupling. Try it yourself!
- Fixed a bug in the unadvertised spy library that's part of the testmints suite
- Actually updated my LinkedIn content (hey, it was real stale before)
- Started working with a tweaked kotlin/react paradigm that hopefully results in easier to build modules. We'll see!

Ok, back to this week's work. Ciao!
