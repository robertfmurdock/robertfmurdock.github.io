# The Search for Meaning(ful work)

## Thesis

In order to further grow in my career, there are a small set of dimensions that a job must fulfill. These dimensions are only viable, however, when sufficiently free of the poisons that make succeeding in that dimension sisyphean. The following will express these dimensions, and the associated common poisons, so that myself and those finding work on my behalf understand my needs.

## Dimensions 

For me, these are the top dimensions when I think of what makes my work meaningful.

  - Building valuable products
  - Building resilient teams and team-spaces
  - Building next-generation teamwork processes
  
Lets unpack these more.

### Building valuable products

The "valuable product" dimension illustrates that the work is clearly focused on finding or focusing a product, and that product solves a real observed problem.

Components of this include:
  
  - Improving underlying technology
  - Keeping the product concept is user focused
  - Ensuring Users are built into the development process
  - Tools for building the project are chosen and discarded based on utility, by the team using them
  - Clear, short-term roll-out strategies for new products or new features. 

Known poisons:

  - Technology decisions being made independent of the team
  - Product sponsors are disengaged or disinterested (deferring responsibility)
  - Users are distant from the process, or the resources needed to properly engage the users are not available
  - Poor strategy for, or poor communication regarding, product release
  - Team identifies critical usability or utility concerns, but the product plan does not adjust to compensate.
   

### Building Resilient Teams and Team-Spaces

The "resilient team" dimension illustrates team and organizational development. In contract to the "valuable product" dimension, this one focuses on developing the organization itself, rather than a product that solves a problem.

Components of this include:

  - Setting up norms or processes that make the team comfortable with change
  - Nurturing a culture of teaching
  - Normalizing the practice of improving or replacing systems over time
  - Helping the team practice self-management
  - Establishing processes for clear communication of the team's needs and successes
  - The team can survive and thrive for multiple generations
  
Known poisons:

  - Team has no persistent center of gravity (viable centers include: owning a product, a team mission, a clear physical home)
  - The team does not have control over team composition (who should join, who should leave)
  - The team is not allowed to set clear boundaries on how stakeholders interact with it.
  - The team's existence is not part of a larger organizational vision, leaving its future in question.
  - The team's senior members are not invested in the existence of the team (the team wants to disband)
  - Team patrons or stakeholders are not responsive to the team's needs or successes

### Building Next-Gen Teamwork Processes

Components of this include:

  - A more Continuous Integration (CI++, improving speed of integrating tech)
  - Continuous Design Integration aka, building processes for faster and safer design integration
  - Better, easier, testing. Unifying tooling in polyglot systems, etc.
  - Processes that take advantage of large scale or cloud functionality.
  
Known poisons:

  - Team has no control over integration processes
  - Over 25% of the team is not committed, or adverse to improving processes
  - existing artifact is too change-intolerant to make process improvement a near-term goal (always on fire)
  - team doesn't share a conceptual model of how they do work, and therefore cannot collaborate on how to improve it, or refuse to compromise on personal styles
  - resource or permission constraints on improving the process, that cause continuous additional friction to change
  
  ## Mission
  
  In order for work to be meaningful, I need at least one of these major categories to be fulfilled with minimal (essentially zero) poison, as an assurance that the work will *stick*. Work that fits all these dimensions, but is poisoned in all of them is not meaningful.
