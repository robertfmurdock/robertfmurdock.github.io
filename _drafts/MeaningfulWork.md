# The Search for Meaning(ful work)

For me, these are the top dimensions when I think of what makes my work meaningful.

  - Building valuable products
  - Building resilient teams and team-spaces
  - Building next-generation teamwork processes
  
Lets unpack these more.

### Building valuable products

Components of this include:
  
  - improving underlying technology
  - product concept is user focused
  - users are built into the development process
  - tools are chosen and discarded based on utility, by the project team
  - a clear, short-term roll-out strategy for new products or new features. 

Known poisons:

  - technology decisions being made independent of the team
  - product sponsors are disengaged or disinterested (deferring responsibility)
  - users are distant from the process, or the resources needed to properly engage the users are not available
  - poor strategy for, or poor communication regarding, product release
  - team identifies critical usability or utility concerns, but the product plan does not adjust to compensate.
   

### Building Resilient Teams and Team-Spaces

Components of this include:

  - setting up processes that make the team comfortable with change
  - nurturing a culture of teaching
  - normalizing the practice of improving or replacing systems over time
  - helping the team practice self-management
  - establishing processes for clear communication of the team's needs and successes
  - teams that can survive and thrive for multiple generations
  
Known poisons:

  - team has no persistent center of gravity (viable centers include: owning a product, a team mission, a clear physical home)
  - the team does not have control over team composition (who should join, who should leave)
  - the team is not allowed to set clear boundaries on how stakeholders interact with it.
  - the team's existence is not part of a larger organizational vision, leaving its future in question.
  - the team's senior members are not invested in the existence of the team (the team wants to disband)
  - team patrons or stakeholders are not responsive to the team's needs or successes


### Building Next-Gen Teamwork Processes

Components of this include:

  - A more Continuous Integration (CI++, improving speed of integrating tech)
  - Continuous Design Integration aka, building processes for faster and safer design integration
  - Better, easier, testing. Unifying tooling in polyglot systems, etc.
  - Processes that take advantage of large scale or cloud functionality.
