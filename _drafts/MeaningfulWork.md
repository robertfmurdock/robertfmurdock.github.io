# The Search for Meaning(ful work)

For me, these are the top dimensions when I think of what makes my work meaningful.

  - Building valuable products
  - Building resilient teams and team-spaces
  - Building next-generation teamwork processes
  
Lets unpack these more.

### Building valuable products

Components of this include:
  
  - improving underlying technology
  - product concept is user focused
  - users are built into the development process
  - tools are chosen and discarded based on utility, by the project team
  
### Building Resilient Teams and Team-Spaces

Components of this include:

  - setting up processes that make the team comfortable with change
  - nurturing a culture of teaching
  - normalizing the practice of improving or replacing systems over time
  - helping the team practice self-management
  - establishing processes for clear communication of the team's needs and successes
  - teams that can survive and thrive for multiple generations
