# Goals for Next Gen Teamwork Processes

Here are a series of goals, regarding the "Next Gen Processes" dimension. In any work context, I intend to try to progress this dimension in as many of these ways as possible.

  * Non-blocking code review facilitation, possibly tools for this
    * learn ins/outs of the IntelliJ Upsource product
    * learn ins/outs of the IntelliJ Space product
    * maybe build new technology
    * consider transient meta-comments
  * Automated dependency updates, possibly tools to make it easier to build into a product's development cycle
    * build into gradle for java / kotlin / android projects?
    * common pattern for many build systems 
  * Design process for more continuously integrating work from developers at widely divergent levels of trust
  * Formalizing testing "levels", to support building tools that can take advantage of known properties of a testing level
  * Advanced (likely remote) build caching for fast builds in larger mono-repos
  * Build tooling for measuring test runtime, frequency of running, health. Possibly a recommendation engine regarding problems.
  * Build standardized "json logging" format for tests, and tooling that supports such an event stream.
