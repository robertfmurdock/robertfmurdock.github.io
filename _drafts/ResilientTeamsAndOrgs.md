# Goals for Resilient Teams and their Organizations

* implement and iterate on processes + systems that communicate team state and needs with outside parties, including
    * the hiring group
    * other teams
    * project-finding group
    * finance and billing
* build/refine systems for balancing team needs with individual needs
* create spaces that allow for ongoing relationship building as well as personal skill growth (each of these is empowered by the other)
* establishing & demonstrating continuous product and process improvement, such that teams are expected to speak to how they've been improving in a meta-sense (indirect product value)
* establishing a multi-team ecosystem that enables the benefits of ongoing change (avoiding the stagnant team problem) without losing the benefits of long term relationships and contact
* establishing team constitutions that allow for self-management 
* Building working norms that allow for more modular working styles - part time work. Solving this problem is both a triumph for human-friendly workplaces, and a professional edge over other organizations that haven't solved it.
