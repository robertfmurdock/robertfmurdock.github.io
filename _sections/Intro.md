## Welcome!
I am RoB Murdock.

I'm a software engineer, collaboration advocate, and lifelong learner.

This is my collection of thoughts, ideas, and public work.

I (very occasionally) blog at [Loose Sequential Musings](/blog.html).

If you dig what you find, please leave me a nice note!

Be excellent to each other.
