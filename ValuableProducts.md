title: Goals for Building Valuable Products
tags: pairing development programming agile discipline
---

Here are a series of goals, regarding the "Valuable Products" dimension. In any work context, I intend to try to progress this dimension in as many of these ways as possible.

* coaching the right staffing balance of user-design/development for each phase of the product
* building extremely rapid integration between user-design & development
* using "minimal viable estimates" to give planning team meaningful choices in the short AND long term.
* collaborate on vivid product visions, to show the intended goal
* maximizing the "flatness" of the build process
  * as full-stack as possible
  * finding natural breaking points where true full-stack breaks down, and isolating derivative products/services at those points
* constructing app architectures that are flexible enough for many user interfaces, possibly simultaneously
* keeping the underlying tech "up-to-date" w/o adversely affecting product development
* building a mature test process to maximize time spent improving the product and minimize unanticipated technical drag
* improving the user interfaces to be cutting edge (means different things for different kinds of interfaces)
* using quality existing paid services to expedite product development (where appropriate), for this such as auth, observability, identity management, etc.
